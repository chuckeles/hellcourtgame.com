### Preparing for School

Last week has been pretty stressful. My school is starting and I was moving to a dorm room. I also had to do a lot of administrative things for the school. Because of this, I have not made any significant progress on Hell Court. That's also why there have not been any blog posts.

### Project Management

I have been thinking a lot about how I'm going to manage the project. I tried a few things, apps and techniques. Finally, I've decided to use [Trello](https://trello.com/). The [board is public](https://trello.com/b/GLKyvtF3/hell-court), feel free to use it to track my progress, comment, provide feedback, whatever you like.
