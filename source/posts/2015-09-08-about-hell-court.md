Hell Court is a game I originally made for [Ludum Dare #33](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=33094). The theme was "You are the monster". Here's what the original was and what the full version will be.

### Origins

The idea behind the game was that you are a devil in a hell dungeon. Humans come down there to pay for their sins. Every human has a random number of randomly generated sins. You have to deal appropriate amount of mental and physical pain based on human's sins. You also have minions - skeletons that do funny things. Then some weird contraptions like a healing table and a flamer.

I received a very valuable feedback on the game. Pretty much everybody liked the game, some players had great ideas about how to make the game better. So I decided to continue working on the game and make it into a full version.

### Full Version

The platform element in the original version was not necessary. It sometimes even got in the way of playing the game. So in the full version, there will only be a basic movement to move around the level but nothing more. You also won't control just one minion, but you will be able to possess any one of them.

The full version will focus on the management element of the gameplay. The game will mostly be about managing a successful hell dungeon, dealing with humans effectively. There will be several types of sins and more ways to deal pain.

Possessing minions won't be the only way to operate your dungeon. You will also be able to assign commands to you minions. You will be able to tell them what to do with humans, where to move, etc. I'm also thinking about allowing loops and conditionals in the commands. That way you could automate your dungeon.

So now you know what to expect. Stay tuned for more development blog posts.
