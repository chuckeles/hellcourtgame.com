All 3 characters can now **move** around the level. Yay! The devil and the skeleton have the same movement speed. The human has a slightly lower speed.

Every character has 2 collision volumes. A circle at the bottom for smooth movement. And a box for the rest of the body.

I'm using the built-in Unity physics. The **movement** script just sets the velocity on the body. **Jumping** works the same.

### Animations

I have also added **animations** for the characters. Currently used animations are standing, walking, falling and landing. Hands are separate game objects attached to the characters. They have separate animations for falling and landing.

It's time to move the [Movement Trello card](https://trello.com/c/mMWzDeua) to the Done list.
