Today I've **redrawn** characters in the game. There's currently a **skeleton**, a **devil** and a **human**.

For every one of them, I've drawn a **walking**, **standing**, **falling**, **landing** and **lying** animations. I have separated **arms** from the rest of the body so that I can separate the animation logic for carrying from the rest. Here's how the walking animations look:
