<p>Today I&#x2019;ve finally built and published the Hell Court development blog. This is the first blog post.</p><p>This website is a development blog for Hell Court, my upcoming game. Hell Court is about managing hell dungeon. Humans come down there to be punished for their sins. It&#x2019;s up to you to decide how to deal with them.</p><p>I will post progress updates on the game to this blog. It will contain newest information, code samples, images, etc. Later I plan to add my Github milestones to this website. I use them to track progress and information about them will be displayed here.</p><p>I tried to keep the website as simple as possible. Currently there are no client-side scripts and few css stylesheets. The website is built using <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/"><span class=icon>l</span> Metalsmith</a>, a cool plugin based static site generator. The build files are then hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/"><span class=icon>l</span> Github Pages</a>. The source code is hosted on <a href=https://github.com/chuckeles/hellcourtgame.com><span class=icon>l</span> Github</a>.</p><p>There are still things to add to the website, such as an about page, newsletter, gallery, etc. These will be added throughout time.</p><p>Thanks for reading! If you&#x2019;d like to know more, write to me on <a href=https://twitter.com/9chuckeles9><span class=icon>l</span> Twitter</a>. If you like this blog, go ahead and tell others!</p>
