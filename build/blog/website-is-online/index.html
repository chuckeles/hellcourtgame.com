This is the first blog post.</p><p>This website is a development blog for Hell Court, my upcoming game. Hell Court is about managing hell dungeon. Humans come down there to be punished for their sins. It’s up to you to decide how to deal with them.</p><p>I will post progress updates on the game to this blog. It will contain newest information, code samples, images, etc. Later I plan to add my Github milestones to this website. I use them to track progress and information about them will be displayed here.</p><p>I tried to keep the website as simple as possible. Currently there are no client-side scripts and few css stylesheets. The website is built using <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a>, a cool plugin based static site generator. The build files are then hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The source code is hosted on <a href=https://github.com/chuckeles/hellcourtgame.com>Github</a>.</p><p>There are still things to add to the website, such as an about page, newsletter, gallery, etc. These will be added throughout time.</p><p>Thanks for reading! If you’d like to know more, write to me on <a href=https://twitter.com/9chuckeles9>Twitter</a>. If you like this blog, go ahead and tell others!</p></main><footer class=site-footer><p><a href=""><span class=icon>o</span> Home</a> &middot; <a href=https://twitter.com/9chuckeles9><span class=icon>t</span> Twitter</a> &middot; <a href=#top><span class=icon>u</span> Top</a></p></footer></body></html>
